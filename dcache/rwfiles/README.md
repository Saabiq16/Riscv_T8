This folder contains modified versions of the original Shakti dcache1rw.bsv and dcache2rw.bsv files.
The changes are focused on enabling support for two new cache replacement policies:

      drepl == 3 â†’ FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
      drepl == 4 â†’ LFU (Least Frequently Used)

These two new policies were integrated into the replacement update logic without altering unrelated logic in the original files.

âœ… The updates are minimal and localized â€” only the relevant replacement policy if-else sections have been edited.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshots below highlight the modified code regions, showing exactly where and how the new logic was inserted.
